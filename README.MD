- A simple console application is sufficient.
- Submission can be in any programming language that they are comfortable with, there must be clear instructions on how to run the code.
- Submission can be in Java, Python, Typescript, or Javascript that they are comfortable with. There must be clear instructions on how to run the code.
- Submissions without any form of Automated Testing will not be considered.
